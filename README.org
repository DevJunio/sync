** FAQ
*** What should I put on =private=?
I recommend to use the same folder structure as the main directory, and use it for private stuff like passwords, ssh keys, etc. and use it on 
_quick example_:
- ssh/ :: your .ssh keys (make sure it's encrypted)
- gpg/ :: your .gpg keys (make sure it's encrypted)
- notes/ :: Journal, intrusive thoughts, this kind of thing. (depending on what is inside, make sure it's also encrypted)
- media/  :: Definetly not pirated movies, music, etc.
- |_ books/ :: books

*** Why name =config= instead of =XDG_CONFIG=?
Isn't always that I'll be using X11, and also the _xdg\__ part would mess with the naming convention (all lowercase, no symbols)
